## Approach for the game

- The game's concept is that there has been a clash in class 202, and one player receives 7 paper balls. The aim is to toss them into a bucket that is eventually moved across by the opponent. To win the game, the player must score 500 points, with each toss into the bucket awarding 100 points.
