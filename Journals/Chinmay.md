"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - Leonardo Da Vinci

## Week 1 
The team had it's first ever meeting. Every team member was ready to put ideas on the table but first we all had gauge each other's working styles and compatibilities. Although we had different takes on what type of game to build we all agreed that we wanted to build a game. Then the next task was to discern the primary technology or framework to be used and our options were Greenfoot, Java (Swift), Unity or JavaScript. I was rooting for Unity because I really liked the platform and getting to build a useful, fun game on it would be an immense experience for me. At this point we all started looking at different prospects and we all found games that we were excited to conduct. The project required design pattern implemetations which I think are necessary for any sort of development now. Considering all these factors we decided to keep it _simple_; we went forward with greenfoot as our project platform.

Now, we had to analyse our game choices and finalize a project where we could simply add features using design principles. As I was promoting _Simplicity_; I agreed and pushed for the paper throwing game. This game was simple which enabled us to add design pattern based features. After pitching around 6 features to my team, based on the viability and practicality, we decided to implement 4 of them


## Week 2
After deciding the features and the platform it was time for work division. However, all of us were new to development in greenfoot, so we decided to spend some time trying to learn the technology. I had never encountered a gaming environment so I took some _feedback_ from my teammates as to how they were minimizing their learning curve. I learned that one of them implemented a small game to get their hands dirty with the APIs of greenfoot. So I decided to do the same. And also applied a singleton pattern (the simplest) to understand how these two things will happen. At this point we were ready to divide modules. I took up the ScoreCard and Win/Lose screen modules.


## Week 3 
I decided to use the Observer and Singleton patterns to implement the ScoreCard feature. After taking feedback from my teammates on my design, I started working on my feature. The ScoreCard kept a count of number of PaperRolls left that the Fighter can shoot and the Fighter's current score. After discussing with Harsh as he had the paper roll throwing feature, I made the PaperRoll the subject and the ScoreCard an observer of the PaperRoll.
