## Week 1

Completed:

- Planned to create a Java-based game for the Greenfoot software. The idea is to produce a game called "Clash In Classroom," and the team is now assessing which components the game will need to include.

Plan to do:

- Installing and familiarizing myself with the Greenfoot tool at it is required to properly appreciate all of its features.
- I've begun drawing the game's user interface wireframes, which will help me visualize how all of the game's components will look.
- Now that the technology is in place, it's time to gather game ideas that will help in the selection of the best.

Blockers:

- None

## Week 2

Completed:

- Decided all the features to include in the game.
- Created UI Wireframes.

Plan to do:

- Searching for game actors, background images and background sounds.
- Creating Instructions page for the user to understand the game properly.
- Setting up game controls on how user will move around and throw paper balls

Blockers:

- None

## Week 3

Completed:

- Finalized the game actors, game background and game sounds
- Fixed the initial game controls

Plan to do:

- Start to implement the Main Screen for the game and use Command Pattern for multiple buttons(fight and instructions).
- Create Instructions page and add return and fight button code setup.
- Create Initial game screen and set up all the actors at their place and perform the movements of actors and how the player will throw the ball in the bucket.
- Imply State pattern in order to check if user still has paper to throw or not. If Yes, then only the fighter is allowed to throw the Paper else the state should be set to noPaperState.

Blockers:

- Paper is still getting thrown even after the paper's were over.

## Week 4

Completed:

- Fixed the blocker where paper where getting thrown and now it will not throw paper if there is no paper left with user.
- Created the main screen, added and adjusted the background, added game sound, added command pattern for the buttons on the screen
- Created and added Insturctions image and created 2 buttons on the page to return back to main screen and to start the game using the same command pattern implementation.
- Positioned all the actors and other components used to play the game including the fighter, opponent with bucket, and the throw of paper. Added their movement within the game and implemented the game logic.

Plan to do:

- Finalize documents
- Create User Story Video Ad to sell the game.
- Create Demo Video for the game.
